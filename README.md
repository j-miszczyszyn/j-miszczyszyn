### Hello, I'm Jakub Miszczyszyn 
I work as a technician in the Department of Forest Resources Management at the University of Agriculture in Krakow, Poland. My research and work are deeply embedded in the innovative use of drones, LiDAR scanners, multispectral cameras, and satellite imagery to revolutionize forestry through geoinformation.
### What I'm diving into üíª
-Leveraging drone technology to gather precise, high-resolution data on forest conditions, enabling more informed management decisions and conservation efforts.
-Utilizing LiDAR scanners to create detailed 3D models of forest structures, improving our understanding of forest biomass and carbon storage capabilities.
-Employing multispectral cameras to monitor the health of forests, detect disease outbreaks, and assess the impact of environmental factors on vegetation.
-Analyzing satellite imagery to study large-scale environmental changes and their effects on forests, enhancing our ability to respond to global challenges.

### My Mission üåç
I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of how geospatial technologies can be used in forestry. By integrating advanced aerial and satellite-based imaging techniques, I aim to contribute significantly to sustainable forest management practices and the broader field of environmental conservation.

### Let's connect and innovate together! ü§ù

I'm on a continuous journey to explore and innovate in the realm of geoinformation for forestry. If you're interested in GIS, drones, LiDAR, or any aspect of environmental technology, let's connect! I'm open to collaborations, discussions, and sharing insights with fellow researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts in this dynamic field.
